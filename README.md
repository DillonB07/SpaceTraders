# SpaceTraders

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DillonB07/SpaceTraders)

SpaceTraders is an awesome game played via REST APIs. This is a simple interface made with Flask to allow users to play the game in a GUI.

Because SpaceTraders is in alpha, there is a server reset every Saturday at 9PM PST(Sunday 5AM BST). Learn more about SpaceTraders on the [SpaceTraders website](https://spacetraders.io). At the time of the reset, the SpaceTraders development team will occasionally post breaking changes. If you come across any breaking changes whilst playing the game on my website, please let me know by filing an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DillonB07/SpaceTraders/issues).

## Usage

Currently, this is in development, not ready to be used. If you want to play it via my website, you will have to run the following commands in your Terminal or Comman

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:DillonB07/SpaceTraders.git
cd SpaceTraders
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
